#Overview

This is a plugin created specifically for a Unity / NEAR course by Morgan Page.
At the time no quick/easy plugin for NEAR integration was available hence this!

#Limitations

At this time, only WebGL builds are supported.
In the Unity editor calls are 'faked', deploy to WebGL to see the action!

#Installation

Build Setting -> Platform = WebGL
Player Settings -> Player -> Resolution and Presentation -> WebGL Template = NEAR
Open RFG->NEAR->Example->ExampleScene
NearCanvas->NearController - Set your contract id and network
